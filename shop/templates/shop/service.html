                    <p class="text-gray-600">Mobile phone unlocking refers to the process of removing carrier restrictions from a device, allowing it to be used with different network providers. When a phone is locked, it can only operate with the specific carrier it was purchased from, often as part of a contract or installment plan. Unlocking typically requires contacting the carrier for an unlock code or using third-party services, and the phone must meet certain conditions, like completing the contract or being fully paid off.</p>
